# Key Exchange Mechanisms

Key exchange methods are used to exchange [cryptographic keys](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-a-cryptographic-key/) between two parties securely. This is an essential part of many cryptographic protocols, as the security of the encryption used to protect communication relies on the secrecy of the keys. There are many key exchange methods, each with unique characteristics and strengths. Some key exchange methods are more secure than others, and the appropriate method depends on the situation's specific circumstances and requirements.

These methods typically work by allowing the two parties to agree on a **shared secret key** over an insecure communication channel that encrypts the communication between them. This is generally done using some form of mathematical operation, such as a computation based on the properties of a mathematical function or a series of simple manipulations of the key.
