### What's Networking Topologies ?
A network topology is a typical arrangement and physical or logical connection of devices in a network. Computers are hosts, such as clients and servers, that actively use the network. They also include network components such as switches, bridges, and routers, which we will discuss in more detail in later sections, which have a distribution function and ensure that all network hosts can establish a logical connection with each other. The network topology determines the components to be used and the access methods to the transmission media.
