## What's Networking Topologies ?
A network topology is a typical arrangement and physical or logical connection of devices in a network. Computers are hosts, such as clients and servers, that actively use the network. They also include network components such as switches, bridges, and routers, which we will discuss in more detail in later sections, which have a distribution function and ensure that all network hosts can establish a logical connection with each other. The network topology determines the components to be used and the access methods to the transmission media.

Physical topology and logical topology are two important concepts in computer networks that refer to how devices are connected and how data is transmitted within a network:
### Physical Topology
Physical topology refers to the physical arrangement and connection of devices in a network, including:
- Cabling plan: The routes that cables take to connect devices to each other.
- Node positions: The exact locations of devices (such as computers, servers, routers) in the network.
- Connections: How devices are connected to the cables and network equipment.
Simply put, physical topology is the visible map of the actual connections of devices. Examples of physical topology include:
- Star topology: Devices are connected to a central switch or hub.
- Ring topology: Each device is connected to the next, forming a ring.
- Bus topology: All devices are connected through a shared cable.
### Logical Topology
Logical topology refers to how data is transmitted between devices in a network, which may differ from the physical topology. It includes:
- How signals move on the transmission medium: For example, the paths data takes to be sent and received.
- Data transfer mechanisms: The pattern and sequence by which data is sent from one device to another.

### **For example:**
- In Ethernet networks, the physical topology might be a star, but the logical topology may operate like a bus because data is logically broadcast to all devices.
- In a wireless network, there might be no physical topology, but the logical topology defines how devices communicate and exchange data.

### Key Difference
- Physical topology: The actual structure and hardware arrangement of the network.
- Logical topology: The functional operation and data transmission within the network.
