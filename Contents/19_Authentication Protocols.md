Many different authentication protocols are used in networking to **verify the identity** of devices and users. Those protocols are essential because they provide a secure and standardized way of verifying the identity of users, devices, and other entities in a network. Without authentication protocols, it would be difficult to securely and reliably identify entities in a network, making it easy for attackers to gain unauthorized access and potentially compromise the network.

Authentication protocols also provide a means for **securely exchanging information** between entities in a network which we will discuss briefly. This is important for ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data and preventing unauthorized access and other security threats. Let us take a look at a few most commonly used authentication protocols:
