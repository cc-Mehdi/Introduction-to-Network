# The OSI Model

The goal in defining the **ISO/OSI** standard was to create a reference model that enables the communication of different technical systems via various devices and technologies and provides compatibility. The **OSI** model uses **seven** different layers, which are hierarchically based on each other to achieve this goal. These layers represent phases in the establishment of each connection through which the sent packets pass. In this way, the standard was created to trace how a connection is structured and established visually.
