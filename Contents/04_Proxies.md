## What is proxy ?

A proxy, in general, refers to a device or service that acts as an intermediary in communication between two parties. The key role of being an intermediary in a proxy is that the middle device must be able to inspect the contents of the traffic. If the middle device simply passes the traffic through without inspection, it is called a Gateway, not a proxy.

## Types of Proxies:

1. Dedicated Proxy / Forward Proxy
- This type of proxy helps end users connect to the internet.
- The user sends their requests to the proxy, and the proxy forwards them to the destination.
- It is usually used for purposes such as bypassing restrictions, caching data, or access control.

2. Reverse Proxy
- This type of proxy is placed on the server side and manages incoming requests from users.
- It is often used to improve security, load balancing, or to hide the details of actual servers.
- Tools like Cloudflare or ModSecurity fall into this category.

3. Transparent Proxy
- In this type of proxy, users may not be aware that their traffic is passing through a proxy.
- It is often used by organizations for traffic control or monitoring.


## Difference Between VPN and Proxy:

Many people mistakenly think that changing an IP address means using a proxy. However, a VPN (Virtual Private Network) is more commonly used for changing geographical location and encrypting traffic. But a VPN in most cases is not a proxy, because it doesnâ€™t act as an intermediary for inspecting content; instead, it encrypts and tunnels the traffic.


## OSI Layer and Proxy:

A proxy typically operates at Layer 7 (Application Layer) of the OSI model, as it deals with inspecting content (such as HTTP requests). This differentiates it from a Gateway or VPN, which may operate at lower layers, such as Layer 3 (Network Layer).
