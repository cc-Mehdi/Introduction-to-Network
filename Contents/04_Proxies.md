## What is proxy ?

A proxy, in general, refers to a device or service that acts as an intermediary in communication between two parties. The key role of being an intermediary in a proxy is that the middle device must be able to inspect the contents of the traffic. If the middle device simply passes the traffic through without inspection, it is called a Gateway, not a proxy.

## Difference Between VPN and Proxy:

Many people mistakenly think that changing an IP address means using a proxy. However, a VPN (Virtual Private Network) is more commonly used for changing geographical location and encrypting traffic. But a VPN in most cases is not a proxy, because it doesnâ€™t act as an intermediary for inspecting content; instead, it encrypts and tunnels the traffic.


## OSI Layer and Proxy:

A proxy typically operates at Layer 7 (Application Layer) of the OSI model, as it deals with inspecting content (such as HTTP requests). This differentiates it from a Gateway or VPN, which may operate at lower layers, such as Layer 3 (Network Layer).

## Types of Proxies:

1. Dedicated Proxy / Forward Proxy
- This type of proxy helps end users connect to the internet.
- The user sends their requests to the proxy, and the proxy forwards them to the destination.
- It is usually used for purposes such as bypassing restrictions, caching data, or access control.

2. Reverse Proxy
- This type of proxy is placed on the server side and manages incoming requests from users.
- It is often used to improve security, load balancing, or to hide the details of actual servers.
- Tools like Cloudflare or ModSecurity fall into this category.

3. Transparent Proxy
- In this type of proxy, users may not be aware that their traffic is passing through a proxy.
- It is often used by organizations for traffic control or monitoring.


## Dedicated Proxy / Forward Proxy

The **Forward Proxy**, is what most people imagine a proxy to be. A Forward Proxy is when a client makes a request to a computer, and that computer carries out the request.

For example, in a corporate network, sensitive computers may not have direct access to the Internet. To access a website, they must go through a proxy (or web filter). This can be an incredibly powerful line of defense against malware, as not only does it need to bypass the web filter (easy), but it would also need to be proxy aware or use a non-traditional C2 (a way for malware to receive tasking information). If the organization only utilizes FireFox, the likelihood of getting proxy-aware malware is improbable.

Web Browsers like Internet Explorer, Edge, or Chrome all obey the "System Proxy" settings by default. If the malware utilizes [WinSock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winsock) (Native Windows API), it will likely be proxy aware without any additional code. Firefox does not use WinSock and instead uses [libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/), which enables it to use the same code on any operating system. This means that the malware would need to look for Firefox and pull the proxy settings, which malware is highly unlikely to do.

Alternatively, malware could use DNS as a [c2 mechanism](https://pentera.io/glossary/command-and-control-c2-attacks/#:~:text=Command%20and%20Control%20(C2)%20refers%20to%20the%20mechanisms%20used%20by,to%20malware%20on%20compromised%20devices.), but if an organization is monitoring DNS (which is easily done using [Sysmon](https://medium.com/falconforce/sysmon-11-dns-improvements-and-filedelete-events-7a74f17ca842) ), this type of traffic should get caught quickly.

Another example of a Forward Proxy is [Burp Suite](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-burp-suite/), as most people utilize it to forward HTTP Requests. However, this application is the swiss army knife of HTTP Proxies and can be configured to be a reverse proxy or transparent!
