# Subnetting 

The division of an address range of IPv4 addresses into several smaller address ranges is called **subnetting**.

A subnet is a logical segment of a network that uses IP addresses with the same network address. We can think of a subnet as a labeled entrance on a large building corridor. For example, this could be a glass door that separates various departments of a company building. With the help of subnetting, we can create a specific subnet by ourselves or find out the following outline of the respective network:

- Network address
- Broadcast address
- First host
- Last host
- Number of hosts

Let us take the following IPv4 address and subnet mask as an example:

- IPv4 Address: **192.168.12.160**
- Subnet Mask: **255.255.255.192**
- CIDR: **192.168.12.160/26**
