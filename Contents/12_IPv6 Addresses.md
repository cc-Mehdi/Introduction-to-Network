**IPv6** is the successor of IPv4. In contrast to IPv4, the **IPv6** address is **128** bit long. The **prefix** identifies the host and network parts. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (**IANA**) is responsible for assigning IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and their associated network portions. In the long term, **IPv6** is expected to completely replace IPv4, which is still predominantly used on the Internet. In principle, however, IPv4 and IPv6 can be made available simultaneously (**Dual Stack**).

IPv6 consistently follows the **end-to-end** principle and provides publicly accessible IP addresses for any end devices without the need for NAT. Consequently, an interface can have multiple IPv6 addresses, and there are special IPv6 addresses to which multiple interfaces are assigned.

**IPv6** is a protocol with many new features, which also has many other advantages over IPv4:

- Larger address space
- Address self-configuration (SLAAC)
- Multiple IPv6 addresses per interface
- Faster routing
- End-to-end encryption (IPsec)
- Data packages up to 4 GByte

There are four different types of IPv6 addresses:
