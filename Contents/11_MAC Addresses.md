# MAC Addresses

Each host in a network has its own **48**-bit (**6 octets**) **Media Access Control** (**MAC**) address, represented in hexadecimal format. **MAC** is the **physical address** for our network interfaces. There are several different standards for the MAC address:

- Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)
- Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15)
- WLAN (IEEE 802.11)
