# MAC Addresses

Each host in a network has its own **48**-bit (**6 octets**) **Media Access Control** (**MAC**) address, represented in hexadecimal format. **MAC** is the **physical address** for our network interfaces. There are several different standards for the MAC address:

- Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)
- Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15)
- WLAN (IEEE 802.11)

This is because the **MAC** address addresses the physical connection (network card, Bluetooth, or WLAN adapter) of a host. Each network card has its individual MAC address, which is configured once on the manufacturer's hardware side but can always be changed, at least temporarily.

Let's have a look at an example of such a MAC address:

MAC address:

- **DE:AD:BE:EF:13:37**
- **DE-AD-BE-EF-13-37**
- **DEAD.BEEF.1337**
