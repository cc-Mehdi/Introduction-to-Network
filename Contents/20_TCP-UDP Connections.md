[Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) (**TCP**) and [User Datagram Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) (**UDP**) are both protocols used in information and data transmission on the Internet. Typically, TCP connections transmit important data, such as web pages and emails. In contrast, UDP connections transmit real-time data such as streaming video or online gaming.
