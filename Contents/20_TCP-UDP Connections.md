[Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) (**TCP**) and [User Datagram Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) (**UDP**) are both protocols used in information and data transmission on the Internet. Typically, TCP connections transmit important data, such as web pages and emails. In contrast, UDP connections transmit real-time data such as streaming video or online gaming.

**TCP** is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures that all data sent from one computer to another is received. It is like a telephone conversation where both parties remain connected until the call is terminated. If an error occurs while sending data, the receiver sends a message back so the sender can resend the missing data. This makes **TCP** reliable and slower than UDP because more time is required for transmission and error recovery.
