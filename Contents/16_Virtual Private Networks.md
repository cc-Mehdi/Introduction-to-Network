A **Virtual Private Network** (**VPN**) is a technology that allows a secure and encrypted connection between a private network and a remote device. This allows the remote machine to access the private network directly, providing secure and confidential access to the network's resources and services. For example, an administrator from another location has to manage the internal servers so that the employees can continue to use the internal services. Many companies limit servers' access, so clients can only reach those servers from the local network. This is where VPN comes into play, where the administrator connects to the VPN server via the internet, authenticates himself, and thus creates an encrypted tunnel so that others cannot read the data transfer. In addition, the administrator's computer is also assigned a local (internal) IP address through which he can access and manage the internal servers. Administrators commonly use VPNs to provide secure and cost-effective remote access to a company's network. VPN typically uses the ports **TCP/1723** for [Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol](https://www.lifewire.com/home-networking-4781492) **PPTP** VPN connections and **UDP/500** for [IKEv1](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security-vpn/ipsec-negotiation-ike-protocols/217432-understand-ipsec-ikev1-protocol.html) and [IKEv2](https://nordvpn.com/blog/ikev2ipsec/) VPN connections.

This allows employees to access the network and its resources, such as email and file servers, from remote locations, such as their homes or while traveling. There are several reasons why administrators use VPNs. VPNs encrypt the connection between the remote device and the private network, making it much more difficult for attackers to intercept and steal sensitive information. With this, the entire communication is more secure.

Another reason is that VPNs allow employees to access the private network and its resources remotely from anywhere, as long as they have an internet connection. This is particularly useful for employees who need to work remotely, such as those traveling or working from home. Additionally, VPNs can be more cost-effective than other remote access solutions, such as leased lines or dedicated connections, because they use the public internet to connect remote users to the private network.

Moreover, we can use VPNs to connect multiple remote locations, such as branch offices, into a single private network, making it easier to manage and access network resources. However, several components and requirements are necessary for a VPN to work:
