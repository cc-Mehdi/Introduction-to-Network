# Networking Models

Two networking models describe the communication and transfer of data from one host to another, called **ISO/OSI model** and the **TCP/IP model**. This is a simplified representation of the so-called layers representing transferred Bits in readable contents for us.

## The OSI Model

The **OSI** model, often referred to as **ISO/OSI** layer model, is a reference model that can be used to describe and define the communication between systems. The reference model has **seven** individual layers, each with clearly separated tasks.

The term **OSI** stands for **Open Systems Interconnection** model, published by the **International Telecommunication Union (ITU**) and the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**. Therefore, the **OSI** model is often referred to as the **ISO/OSI** layer model.

## The TCP/IP Model

**TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)** is a generic term for many network protocols. The protocols are responsible for the switching and transport of data packets on the Internet. The Internet is entirely based on the **TCP/IP** protocol family. However, **TCP/IP** does not only refer to these two protocols but is usually used as a generic term for an entire protocol family.

For example, **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** or **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** belongs to the protocol family. The protocol family provides the necessary functions for transporting and switching data packets in a private or public network.
