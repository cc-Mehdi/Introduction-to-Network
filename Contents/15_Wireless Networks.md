Wireless networks are computer networks that use wireless data connections between network nodes. These networks allow devices such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets to communicate with each other and the Internet without needing physical connections such as cables.

Wireless networks use radio frequency (**RF**) technology to transmit data between devices. Each device on a wireless network has a wireless adapter that converts data into RF signals and sends them over the air. Other devices on the network receive these signals with their own wireless adapters, and the data is then converted back into a usable form. Those can operate over various ranges, depending on the technology used. For example, a local area network (LAN) that covers a small area, such as a home or small office, might use a wireless technology called **WiFi**, which has a range of a few hundred feet. On the other hand, a wireless wide area network (**WWAN**) might use mobile telecommunication technology such as cellular data (**3G, 4G LTE, 5G**), which can cover a much larger area, such as an entire city or region.

Therefore, to connect to a wireless network, a device must be within range of the network and configured with the correct network settings, such as the network name and password. Once connected, devices can communicate with each other and the Internet, allowing users to access online resources and exchange data.

Communication between devices occurs over RF in the **2.4 GHz** or **5 GHz** bands in a WiFi network. When a device, like a laptop, wants to send data over the network, it first communicates with the Wireless Access Point (**WAP**) to request permission to transmit. The WAP is a central device, like a router, that connects the wireless network to a wired network and controls access to the network.
