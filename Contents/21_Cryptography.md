Encryption is used on the Internet to transmit data, such as payment information, e-mails, or personal data, confidentially and protected against manipulation. Data is encrypted using various cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical operations. With the help of encryption, data can be transformed into a form that unauthorized persons can no longer read. Digital keys in **symmetric** or **asymmetric** encryption processes are used for encryption. It is easier to crack cipher texts or keys depending on the encryption methods used. If state-of-the-art cryptographic methods with extensive key lengths are used, they work very securely and are almost impossible to compromise for the time being. In principle, we can distinguish between **symmetric** and **asymmetric** encryption techniques. Asymmetric methods have only been known for a few decades. Nevertheless, they are the most frequently used methods in digital communication.

### Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption, also known as secret key encryption, is a method that uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data. This means the sender and the receiver must have the same key to decrypt the data correctly.
