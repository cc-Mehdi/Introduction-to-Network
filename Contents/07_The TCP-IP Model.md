# The TCP/IP Model

The **TCP/IP** model is also a layered reference model, often referred to as the **Internet Protocol Suite**. The term **TCP/IP** stands for the two protocols **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** and **Internet Protocol (IP)**. **IP** is located within the **network layer (Layer 3)** and **TCP** is located within the **transport layer (Layer 4)** of the **OSI** layer model.

With **TCP/IP**, every application can transfer and exchange data over any network, and it does not matter where the receiver is located. **IP** ensures that the data packet reaches its destination, and **TCP** controls the data transfer and ensures the connection between data stream and application. The main difference between **TCP/IP** and **OSI** is the number of layers, some of which have been combined.
