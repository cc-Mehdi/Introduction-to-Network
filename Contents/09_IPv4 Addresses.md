Each host in the network located can be identified by the so-called **Media Access Control** address (**MAC**). This would allow data exchange within this one network. If the remote host is located in another network, knowledge of the **MAC** address is not enough to establish a connection. Addressing on the Internet is done via the **IPv4** and/or **IPv6** address, which is made up of the **network address** and the **host address**.

It does not matter whether it is a smaller network, such as a home computer network, or the entire Internet. The IP address ensures the delivery of data to the correct receiver. We can imagine the representation of **MAC** and **IPv4** / **IPv6** addresses as follows:

- **IPv4** / **IPv6** - describes the unique postal address and district of the receiver's building.
- **MAC** - describes the exact floor and apartment of the receiver.
