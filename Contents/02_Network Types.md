In understanding computer networks, it's important to categorize and identify networks based on their **types** and **topologies**. This helps in understanding how data is transferred, what range the network covers, and what itâ€™s best suited for. The terminology related to network types can sometimes be overwhelming due to the mix of practical terms used in everyday scenarios and theoretical ones learned primarily in academic settings.
We rarely hear some of the terminologies in practice, so this section will be broken up into **Common Terms** and **Book Terms**.

# Network Types
Types refer to the nature of the network, often based on scale or purpose, such as **Local Area Network (LAN)**, **Wide Area Network (WAN)**, **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**, and others. They define how far the network spans geographically and the structure of its connectivity.
