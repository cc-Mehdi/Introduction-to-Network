In understanding computer networks, it's important to categorize and identify networks based on their **types** and **topologies**. This helps in understanding how data is transferred, what range the network covers, and what it’s best suited for. The terminology related to network types can sometimes be overwhelming due to the mix of practical terms used in everyday scenarios and theoretical ones learned primarily in academic settings.
We rarely hear some of the terminologies in practice, so this section will be broken up into **Common Terms** and **Book Terms**.


# Network Types
Types refer to the nature of the network, often based on scale or purpose, such as **Local Area Network (LAN)**, **Wide Area Network (WAN)**, **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**, and others. They define how far the network spans geographically and the structure of its connectivity.

### 1. Common Terms:
These are the network types and terminologies that you will frequently encounter in real-world applications:

LAN (Local Area Network): This is a network that covers a small, specific area such as a single building, office, or home. LANs are used for connecting computers and devices within close proximity to share resources like printers or data files.

WAN (Wide Area Network): This type spans a much larger geographical area and is often used to connect multiple LANs. The internet is the most prominent example of a WAN.

WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network): Similar to a LAN, but with the capability to connect devices wirelessly. This is commonly seen in homes, cafes, and offices with Wi-Fi connectivity.

MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): A network that covers a larger area than a LAN but is not as vast as a WAN. Typically, it connects multiple LANs within a city or campus, facilitating communication between branches of an organization or public systems like city-wide Wi-Fi.

PAN (Personal Area Network): A very localized network used for connecting devices around an individual, such as Bluetooth connections between a smartphone and a headset or a laptop and a mouse.

### 2. Book Terms:
These terms are more academic or less commonly used outside specialized discussions or exams:

CAN (Campus Area Network): A network larger than a LAN but confined to a limited geographic area such as a university campus, business campus, or industrial complex.

SAN (Storage Area Network): A network that provides access to consolidated, block-level data storage. SANs are typically used in data centers and enterprise storage environments to enhance performance and availability.

EPN (Enterprise Private Network): A network built and maintained by an organization for private use to connect various sites and ensure secure communication.

VPN (Virtual Private Network): While not exactly a type of network based on geographical range, a VPN extends a private network across a public network. It enables users to send and receive data as if their devices were directly connected to the private network.

BAN (Body Area Network): A specialized type of network involving wearable computing devices that communicate with each other. Common in medical and fitness technology, it covers the area around an individual’s body.
